## Compilation

Run `make` from the root to compile the Rust backend in debug mode.

Run `make release` to compile in optimized release mode

Note that running either of these commands will attempt to generate and install python dependencies with `pip`. This only works if you have `python3` and `pip` already installed.

## Use

Run with `./launch` or `python3 ./launch`
